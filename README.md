# lora-finetuning-agent

an autonomous, multi-agent system designed to assist with the scientific research process. This concept is directly inspired by recent, influential research exploring the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate and accelerate scientific discovery. The system, termed an "Agent Laboratory," will serve as a powerful and relevant portfolio piece that directly mirrors the day-to-day tasks of an AI researcher.  

Core Functionality:
The system will accept a high-level research topic as input, for example, "recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning." It will then orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents to execute a complete, albeit simplified, research workflow:

    Search & Discovery: An agent will be tasked with querying academic databases, such as the ArXiv API, to find relevant and recent research papers based on the input topic.

    Analysis & Extraction: A specialized agent, powered by a fine-tuned LLM, will "read" the retrieved papers. Its function is to extract critical information, such as the paper's core contributions, methodology, limitations, and key results. The fine-tuning process is essential here to adapt a general-purpose LLM to the dense, domain-specific language of scientific literature.   

Synthesis & Reporting: A final agent will synthesize the extracted information from multiple papers, generating a concise summary of the current state of the art and potentially identifying emergent themes or research gaps. This mirrors the process of conducting a literature review.
